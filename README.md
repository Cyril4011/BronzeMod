amazing mod
## Tin Ore/Deepslate Tin Ore:
Tin Ore spawns about at the same level as iron. Each block mined gives 3 Raw Tin.
## Bronze:
Combining 3 Raw Copper with 1 Raw Tin in a crafting table gives 2 Raw Bronze. Raw Bronze can be smelted to give Bronze Ingots.
## Armor/Tools:
Bronze armor and tools can be crafted the way any set of tools or armor are crafted. They have stats in between iron tools/armor and copper tools/armor. 


Note:
I did not realize when I made this mod that the version it is made for does not have copper armor/tools yet. When I can find a way to make a mod for 1.21.11, I will update it to that version instead.
